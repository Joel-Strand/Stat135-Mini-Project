```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval=F)

library(googlesheets4)
library(mosaic)
```

## Import the data
```{r}
#| label: import-data
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval=F)

library(googlesheets4)
library(mosaic)
library(tidyverse)
olympic_dat0 <- readRDS(file=url("https://kcorreia.people.amherst.edu/Stat135/project_scull.Rds")) |>
  separate(Time, into=c("minute", "second"), sep=":", remove=F) |>
  mutate(across(c("minute", "second"), ~parse_number(.))
         , Time_Minutes = minute + (second/60)

```

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
#| label: desc-stats
 
# e.g, can use tally to compute descriptive statistics for categorical variables
#tally(~YOUR_VARIABLE, data=olympic_dat)

tally(~RacingLine, data=olympic_dat0)


# e.g., can use favstats to compute descriptive statistics for quantitative variables
favstats(~Time_Minutes, data=olympic_dat0)

favstats(Time_Minutes ~ RacingLine, data = olympic_dat0)
# e.g., by group
#favstats(YOUR_QUANT_VAR ~ YOUR_GROUP_VAR, data=olympic_dat)
```

## Plot(s)

```{r}
#| label: plotting

# title your plot(s), keeping in mind context and language matter
# be sure to label all axes appropriately 

# see the mosaic cheatsheet, and relevant labs and problem sets for how to
# code the plot you want (using one of the gf_XX functions)
# if you're still stuck or have a question about a particular aspect of the plot,
# come talk to me - I can help you!
```


## Multiple Linear Regression Model 

```{r}
#| label: mlr

# include the code to fit your multiple linear regression model 
# including any checks for relevant assumptions
# and any inferential procedures you did 
# (e.g., hypothesis testing or confidence intervals)
# please use comments to indicate what you're doing
```

### Prediction

```{r}
#| label: predict

# include the code to make your prediction for an athlete who
# is expected to compete in the event this summer

```
