knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval=F)

## Import the data

```{r}
#| label: import-data

# !!! REPLACE THE LINK WITH THE LINK TO YOUR DATA'S GOOGLE SHEET !!!
olympic_dat0 <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cp_VmpyfBeZnY-pYvJ782MA-eOalwcErmH5l8qW3E8E/edit#gid=26032386")

# if you need to derive new variables from variables in your dataset, I can help you!
olympic_dat <- olympic_dat0 |>
  # for example, if you need BMI (kg/m^2)
  # divide height (in cm) by 100 to get height in meters
  mutate(bmi = Weight/((Height/100)^2))
```

## Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
#| label: desc-stats
 
# e.g, can use tally to compute descriptive statistics for categorical variables
tally(~YOUR_VARIABLE, data=olympic_dat)

# e.g., can use favstats to compute descriptive statistics for quantitative variables
favstats(~YOUR_VARIABLE, data=olympic_dat)
# e.g., by group
favstats(YOUR_QUANT_VAR ~ YOUR_GROUP_VAR, data=olympic_dat)
```

## Plot(s)

```{r}
#| label: plotting

# title your plot(s), keeping in mind context and language matter
# be sure to label all axes appropriately 

# see the mosaic cheatsheet, and relevant labs and problem sets for how to
# code the plot you want (using one of the gf_XX functions)
# if you're still stuck or have a question about a particular aspect of the plot,
# come talk to me - I can help you!
```


## Multiple Linear Regression Model 

```{r}
#| label: mlr

# include the code to fit your multiple linear regression model 
# including any checks for relevant assumptions
# and any inferential procedures you did 
# (e.g., hypothesis testing or confidence intervals)
# please use comments to indicate what you're doing
```
